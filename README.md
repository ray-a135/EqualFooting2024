As women of color, we built equal footing to bridge the gap between privelege and potential and serve as an app to help underprivelege students and their families become more aware of opportunities in the work force so that they will not be seen as inferior to their wealthy counterparts. Our app allow the user to take a personality test and matches opportunites (research, programs, interships) to them that are free but also highly accredited.
